# FamilyPhotoManager
This application allows the user to sort a large quantity of pictures into a another directory based on the year the picture was taken. I created this to make it easier to save all of my family pictures onto the cloud in a sorted manner as well as learn about some of the packages java offers for files.

# Directions
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the Java file.

Compile the Java file by running the following command:

Copy code
javac main.java
This command will compile the Java source code and generate a bytecode file called "main.class".

Once the compilation is successful, run the program by executing the following command:

Copy code
java main
This command will execute the Java program and initiate the file sorting process based on the provided directories and logic.

The program will then sort the files in the source directory based on their creation year and move them to the respective destination directories.
